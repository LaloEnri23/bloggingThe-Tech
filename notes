To accomplish your task of building a CMS-style blog site, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up the project structure:
   - Create a new project directory.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project with `npm init`.
   - Install necessary dependencies such as Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, and express-session.

2. Create the database schema and models:
   - Design the database schema to store blog posts, comments, and user information.
   - Create Sequelize models for the database tables, including associations between models.

3. Implement user authentication:
   - Set up user registration and login functionality using `express-session` for session management.
   - Create routes for user authentication, such as sign up, login, and logout.
   - Implement password hashing for secure storage.

4. Build the views:
   - Create Handlebars templates for the homepage, dashboard, blog post display, and other necessary views.
   - Implement the necessary HTML and CSS to style the views and make them user-friendly.

5. Develop the backend functionality:
   - Define routes and controllers for various actions, such as displaying the homepage, creating and updating blog posts, adding and deleting comments.
   - Implement the logic for retrieving and displaying existing blog posts, comments, and user-specific information.

6. Test and debug the application:
   - Test the application by running it locally and verifying that all features work as expected.
   - Debug any issues or errors encountered during testing.

7. Deploy the application:
   - Set up a hosting environment, such as Heroku, to deploy your blog site.
   - Configure the necessary environment variables and deployment settings.
   - Deploy your application and verify its functionality on the live site.

Remember to regularly test and debug your application throughout the development process. Additionally, consider breaking down each step into smaller tasks and implementing them incrementally to ensure a smoother development process.

As you progress through the development, feel free to ask more specific questions or seek guidance on any particular step. Good luck with your project!
